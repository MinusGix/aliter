Currently, this library is trying to maintain implementation parity with the main KaTeX javascript library.  
However, there are currently various TODOs/FIXMEs littered about the code which are deserving of fixing.  
As well, updating us to be closer to the current KaTeX library is useful as well.

(This is the last commit that this code was deliberately based on. Updates towards being like the future commits is currently also a nice way to contribute, since they can provide bug-fixes. Though, if there occurs big architectural changes, then there may be a decision to stay at the current state.)
